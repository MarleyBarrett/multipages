  This collection of pages, otherwise known as Multipages, is accessed from the Home of the Multiverse.
   It was and still is being created as a project by Tryg van Wyk, who is trying to improve his computer programming skills.
    There is going to be a form on this website coming soon to rate your experience here,
    so please check back occasionally to look for that. Thanks.
