  This collection of pages, otherwise known as Multipages, is accessed from the Home of the Multiverse. It was and still is being created as a project by Tryg van Wyk, who is trying to improve his computer programming skills. There is going to be a form on this website coming soon to rate your experience here, so please check back occasionally to look for that. Another thing to notice is the padding around this text, which makes it nicer to look at. Thanks.
